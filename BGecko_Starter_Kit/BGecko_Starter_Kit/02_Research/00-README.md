# Research

**Purpose:** Publish reproducible artifacts (papers, code, datasets, notes) as an engineering discipline.

**Core rules**
- Every claim ties to a traceable artifact (code, derivation, experiment log).
- Reproducibility is non-negotiable (env, seeds, data lineage).
- Peer-review internally before public release.

**Key artifacts**
- Research Cycle SOP (PDF)
- Reproducibility checklist
- Experiment log + literature matrix
- Paper + dataset card templates

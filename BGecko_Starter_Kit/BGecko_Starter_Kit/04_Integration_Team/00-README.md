# Integration Team

**Purpose:** Keep the system coherent: tools, data, security, workflows, and handoffs.

**Core rules**
- One source of truth per domain (content, code, customers, analytics).
- Minimize manual steps; automate small, often.
- Security/privacy basics from day one.

**Key artifacts**
- Systems architecture one-pager (PDF)
- Tooling inventory + integration backlog
- Security and privacy basics
